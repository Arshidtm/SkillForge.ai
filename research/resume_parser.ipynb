      "3. **Language Model**: My language model is based on a transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that is well-suited for NLP tasks. This model allows me to generate text that is context-dependent and takes into account the nuances of language.\n",

If I don't have enough information about a particular topic or if the topic is not well-represented in my training data, I may not be able to generate high-quality text.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of the movie \"Ex Machina\", I was able to generate a coherent and informative text because I have been trained on a large corpus of text data that includes information about movies, including \"Ex Machina\". However, if you ask me about a very obscure or niche topic, I may not be able to generate text of the same quality.\n"
